          <h5>A: This game heavily relies on an intensive GPU-based technology. It will run on any modern PC that is either NVidia or ATI/AMD powered. On a PC with an integrated Intel graphic card we are unable to reproduce the same quality of visual experience. You can always drop us an email, we will try to do our best and see if there's a possible workaround.</h5></td>

      <h5>A: Not really. The question of the the nuclear wastes has always been in our minds, when we started to work on this game, 3 months before the accident in the Fukushima Daiishi NPP. The dramatic accident in Tchernobyl was in our minds. Unfortunately, the events have proven that such a catastrophy can still happen.</h5></td>
